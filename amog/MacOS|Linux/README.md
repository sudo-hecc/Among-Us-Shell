## List of custom made commands

- `venv` - creates a virtual envoirnment and activates it.
- `python3` and `pip3` are shortened to `python` and `pip`.
- `impo rm -rf <target>` - if you are imposter, the terminal prints `<target> has been deleted`.
- `impo kill <target>` - sabotages a process e.g. `impo kill O2` returns `O2 has been sabotaged`.
- `clr` or `clear` - clears the terminal.
- `exit` launches into your default terminal such as `zsh` and displays a message based on your role.
- On start, you have a 50/50 chance of being imposter or crew mate.
- Uses `pygame` to play Among Us theme tune.
- Uses `rich` for styling text in the terminal

### Note:
If you are on Windows, using Powershell is recommended for the ASCII escape codes used by [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)
